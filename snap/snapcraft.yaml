summary: Unison file synchroniser
description: |
  Unison is a file-synchronization tool. It allows two replicas
  of a collection of files and directories to be stored on different
  hosts (or different disks on the same host), modified separately,
  and then brought up to date by propagating the changes in each replica
  to the other.
